## **Inspiration**
The recent pandemic has compelled us to modify our views and change our outlook in all aspects of life, and so has changed our education system too. There were a lot of obstacles that students like us have faced in our education, and this is what inspired us to do something for us and help us study smarter not just harder!

Making and OCR which we though would be very useful in this modern era of education. We get images and have to read or edit text from there a lot of times. This project will make that process much much easier!
This was a completely new project for us and we faced numerous hurdles, but ultimately we have successfully built and deployed it! It has been and wonderful experience building this application!

## **What it does**
- It converts text in image to editable docx file.
- Provides Customized Google Search for specific filetypes Such as PDFs.
- Provides secure cloud note taking that can be accessed from any device. Supports user accounts, updation and deletion of taken notes.

## **Languages used**
- HTML, CSS
- Tailwind
- JS
- Python
- Php
- Dart
- SQL

## **Challenges we ran into**
- Ran into a CORS error in the notes backend API.
- Faced responsiveness issues in the OCR section.
- Struggled hard to make the notes tiles free sized and responsive.
- We Could not implement the search notes and rearrange notes functionality. In spite of being the backend and ready and deployed for this process we could not make the frontend for it, due to shortage of time.

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of**
**It's a fully working MVP.**

The web-app we developed we believe would be very useful in day to day student life and we are proud that we pulled out the application in the given amount of time!

## **What we learnt**
- Built the main page using HTML, CSS and JS. Deployed on Netlify.
- Built the notes web app using Flutter and Dart. Deployed on Netlify.
- Built the OCR backend using Flask API and Pytesseract (Python). Deployed on AWS.
